def test_data_quality():
    """
    Test the data quality using a batch of data.

    This function loads a batch of data from a CSV file and runs a validation operator on the data. The validation operator is specified as "action_list_operator". The batch of data is passed as the "assets_to_validate" parameter. An identifier for this validation run is provided as the "run_id" parameter.

    The function asserts if the validation was successful by checking the "success" key in the results dictionary. If the validation fails, an assertion error is raised with the message "Data quality validation failed".

    Parameters:
    - None

    Returns:
    - None
